This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## How to run the website
1)	Make sure node and npm is installed. This can be checked by running the node -v and npm -v commands in the terminal.

2)	The website is developed using the Next.js framework. There are three ways to access the website:
a.	The project can be downloaded through the zip file found in Blackboard’s assignment submission. In this case, open the digital-diary folder in an IDE and run ‘npm run dev’. If successful, the output of the terminal (VSCode) would be similar to below. Then, access the link in the output (localhost:3000)
